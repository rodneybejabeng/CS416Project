# About the Visualization
The dining sector represents a vast market, and gaining insights into customers and their behavior could provide aspiring restaurant owners with a valuable leg up. This engaging presentation explores the freely accessible Yelp Academic Dataset, which encompasses a wide range of reviews and client interactions across various sectors and regions. Our primary focus is on US-based eateries to derive a better understanding of customer interactions.

Assumptions are drawn regarding the direct relationship between the number of reviews and the business's popularity, as well as the assumed positive correlation between the frequency of check-ins and business popularity. Concentrating on restaurants with a high volume of reviews, frequent check-ins, and superior star ratings will help us pinpoint the type of eatery worth investing in.

Preliminary analysis of the Yelp Academic Dataset suggests that a potential restaurant entrepreneur might be best off launching a restaurant featuring New American cuisine. The preferred locale would be Nevada, which recorded the highest volume of reviews. The establishment should cater to the evening and weekend crowd, possibly scaling back on staff during the day when patronage tends to drop off.
